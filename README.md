# GSOC21_scrapping
This was a assignment for selection, where I had to scrap the name, organization and projects alloted of selected candidates for GSOC21. So I wrote a python script which uses beautifulsoup and selenium libraries to do the web scrapping part. I used the class which were containing the speicific required details to scrap the specified. I have kept the script here, and only input required is the the path to the chromedriver_install.exe in your system, and then the csv file will be generated.
